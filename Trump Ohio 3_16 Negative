Trump 26

___________TRUMP_______________

@AnonHerb3 @rosevine3 @37thRealm Wonderful way to give the election to Trump.

Is it really about to be Hillary vs Trump for president? How can a country like the U.S. really not get better candidates than this?

@TrumpTrain8 @Ricky_Vaughn99   THE AGONY OF DEFEAT!!!  They not in healthy state of mind. Ted needs to PRAY for them!!

I mean, this lady even looks like she's a Trump supporter. And she's covered in white paint and I'm confused. #previoustweet

Praying any Republican candidate (I guess Cruz at this point) beats Trump like the panic attacks are becoming so real

I'm afraid he won't beat her in the general election.  https://t.co/2fA4YBBFjW

Can somebody give me a logical reason to vote for Trump? ðŸ¤”

@LovinJK4Ever @DonnieWahlberg  the bees need sting Trump's ass

@JonahNRO Haha, the Trump troll farms are becoming more civil. Trying to woo us away fr our principles. Only works on the feeble minded tho.

Millions of #Repubs have crossed aisle to vote for Hillary. They believe that Trump can beat her. It's the ONLY reason, she's in the lead.

A lady just walked into this Denny's with a Trump button and now I want to leave immediately. ðŸ™ƒðŸ”«

@iAmGeorgi  ðŸ˜„ We Dems must Unite and Fight to #StopTrump 

@dickfundy I disagree, but I know what we can all agree on. Trump sucks.

Trump is all sorts of terrible things but he's not stupid. Playing people's fears to get into power.#HillaryforPresident

@davidplouffe You are so talented. Jump over the Republican side and help us get Cruz or anyone but Trump elected. #NeverTrump

S/o to the Trump campaign for the racist uneducated &amp; politically uninformed cockroaches scattered on my newsfeed GROSS #DumpTrump

Unofficially...
Winner: Clinton wins all 5 states tonight.
Winner: Trump wins 4/5 states tonight.

Loser: America.

@TimBartender I'm straight up depressed. I'm about to take a shot of Henney.. We need this to turn around or else it's gonna be Pres. Trump

I have always respected others' political opinions (even if I don't agree with them), but Trump as president is simply something I never can

@BroJoeyD I imagine he will, an independent run guarantees a President Cruz or Trump and he knows that.
