___________TRUMP_______________

@J_McCooeye @alllibertynews @ElsarioD @JulieBorowski @obama_speech libs with Hil liar Clinton and Benghazi. Good luck with that. Trump!!

Their dire warnings and feigned concern about a Trump nom are BS. Their actions tell us everything we need to know

Well Trump may have lost to Kasich in Ohio but in my home county Trump prevailed

@davidaxelrod is cnn dragging tonight out, NBC and other outlets called it for Clinton and Trump over 30 minutes ago and say 100% vote in

Just to let you guys know when it was 99% in Missouri I CALLED IT A WIN FOR DONALD  If he wins see ya all could have listen to me N went bed

If I have to choose to vote for Republican Hillary or Republican Trump for President, then I will vote for the one running as a Republican!

My delegates count are by Fox CNN I notice always back track Trump 621 on Fox CNN has him at 640

@TheFive Not voting Trump b/c of SCOTUS appts is irrelevant @kimguilfoyle . Trump already "burned down the GOP". Why not burn it all down?

@ItsRickBitches Fox has him 621

@seanhannity @dariana_ortiz No she can't i don't where people keep saying that Hillary will beat Trump in this election.

Just wanna let you guys know Trump lost to Kasich in Ohio BUT DONALD J MOTHER FUCKING TRUMP HAD MORE VOTE THAN @HillaryClinton  FUCKING AAAA

@JoelWeidenhamer ohio, your display of affection for kasich didn't stop Trump in the end. He's on fire and he'll be back for the general.

@FoxNews I'll take Trump, even if he is cheated out of it by Kasich's brokered convention, I'll write him in.

.@Maggie1715 @TheRightScoop They'd better call it for Trump and move on but GOPe will probably want to give it to Cruz, so expect a recount.

@RichardGrenell @KatiePavlich EXCLUSIVE: Newt Gingrich: If Trump Wins Big in Florida, They Won't Be Able to Stop Him https://t.co/NblOLOhvrG

@lucaslumm war is not inevitable why do you think trump wants to remain neutral with the middle east

@TrumpTrain8 lives will be lost if they fuck trump.

@lucaslumm war is not inevitable why do you think trump wants to remain neutral with the middle east

@PaulBegala @davidgregory GOP or not as long as Trump is president who cares about the GOP.

@Swiger13 sorry John but my home county a predominantly dem one with a GOP party that kisses Kasich ass went 4 Trump.

@FoxNews @foxandfriends @JohnKasich to stay in race just as a spoiler to negate the people's votes for Trump is disgraceful! !!

@Swiger13 sorry John but my home county a predominantly dem one with a GOP party that kisses Kasich ass went 4 Trump.

@politico come on Cruz. We don't need an actor for president

@risetoflyy @tedcruz "we are the only ones who beat trump"

@nicktjacob @ellencarmichael I support Cruz and I'm sorry Rubio lost Florida. He's a good man who fought the good fight.

@washingtonpost @tedcruz What can be done about this?

#PAprimary #CAprimary #AZprimary #WIprimary #NEprimary #UniteWithCruz to #StopTrump #ChooseCruz #NeverTrump  https://t.co/heqBUADtWs

We" hope "Donald Trump keeps his promises. WE KNOW Ted Cruz  Will keep his !

Actions speak louder than words. If Rubio &amp; Kasich were truly worried about conserv mvt, would've bowed out a week ago &amp; teamed up w/ Cruz

So, if you appropriately call Hillary a bitch, you're a misogynist? Ok. Then, she's a scumbag &amp; dickhead. Why? She's a Repub. #PrimaryDay
