@J_McCooeye @alllibertynews @ElsarioD @JulieBorowski @obama_speech libs with Hil liar Clinton and Benghazi. Good luck with that. Trump!!

Their dire warnings and feigned concern about a Trump nom are BS. Their actions tell us everything we need to know

Well Trump may have lost to Kasich in Ohio but in my home county Trump prevailed

@davidaxelrod is cnn dragging tonight out, NBC and other outlets called it for Clinton and Trump over 30 minutes ago and say 100% vote in

Just to let you guys know when it was 99% in Missouri I CALLED IT A WIN FOR DONALD  If he wins see ya all could have listen to me N went bed

If I have to choose to vote for Republican Hillary or Republican Trump for President, then I will vote for the one running as a Republican!

My delegates count are by Fox CNN I notice always back track Trump 621 on Fox CNN has him at 640

@TheFive Not voting Trump b/c of SCOTUS appts is irrelevant @kimguilfoyle . Trump already "burned down the GOP". Why not burn it all down?

@ItsRickBitches Fox has him 621

@seanhannity @dariana_ortiz No she can't i don't where people keep saying that Hillary will beat Trump in this election.

Just wanna let you guys know Trump lost to Kasich in Ohio BUT DONALD J MOTHER FUCKING TRUMP HAD MORE VOTE THAN @HillaryClinton  FUCKING AAAA

@JoelWeidenhamer ohio, your display of affection for kasich didn't stop Trump in the end. He's on fire and he'll be back for the general.

@FoxNews I'll take Trump, even if he is cheated out of it by Kasich's brokered convention, I'll write him in.

Trump 99 Delegates Florida .. Illinois 24 Awarded soooo far everybody else 0 .. NorthCarolina Trump 29 Cruz 26...Missouri tied 11 TRUMP CRUZ

.@Maggie1715 @TheRightScoop They'd better call it for Trump and move on but GOPe will probably want to give it to Cruz, so expect a recount.
